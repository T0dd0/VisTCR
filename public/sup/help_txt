The Clonotype Distribution Plot shows the frequency of each specific amino acid sequence in the TCR repertoire of the selected sample. the X axis is sequence ID, the Y axis is frequency.Both of the coordinates are in logarithm.

#SSTA_CD_CA
@Convergent analysis
The convergent analysis shows a variety of dots, whose area represents the number of unique CDR3 nucleotide sequences that have been translated into the same CDR3 amino acid sequence. The degenerated nucleotide sequences are listed in the upper table.

#PTA_OA_CDNT
@Clonotypes distribution (nt) 
This analysis show the frequencies of the nucleotide sequences that overlap in the selected groups.

#PTA_OA_CDAA
@Clonotypes distribution (aa) 
This analysis show the frequencies of the amino acid sequences that overlap in the selected groups.

#PTA_OA_CA
@Convergent analysis 
The convergent analysis is used to evaluate the degeneracy of the shared T cell clonotypes. The area of the dots represents the number of unique CDR3 nucleotide sequences that are translated into same CDR3 amino acid sequence.


#PTA_UA_CDNT
@Clonotypes distribution (nt) 
The un-overlapping clonotype analysis displays the nt distribution frequency of clonotypes that are not shared between the two data sets. The X axis is sequence ID, the Y axis is frequency. Both of the coordinates are in logarithm.

#PTA_UA_CDAA
@Clonotypes distribution (aa) 
The un-overlapping clonotype analysis displays the aa distribution frequency of clonotypes that are not shared between the two data sets. The X axis is sequence ID, the Y axis is frequency. Both of the coordinates are in logarithm.

#WTRA_DS_MAC
@Most abundant clonotypes 
Analyzing the proportions of the most abundant clonotypesâ€™ sum of reads to the overall number of reads in  combined sample groups.


#WTRA_DS_CSH
@Clonal space homeostasis 
The method shows the proportional distribution of clonetypes according to their sequence frequency in grouped samples. The resulting analysis shows whether the clonotypes have expanded or contracted, which is called space homeostasis. 


#WTRA_DS_CT
@Clonotype tracking 
The upper graph shows the counts that specific clonotypes arise in different datasets, and the lower graph shows the number of clonotypes found in each sharing category.


#WTRA_DS_OA
@Overlap analysis 
The overlap analysis provides a heat-map matrix of the shared number of clonotypes between the grouped data sets.Users can select individual cells in the heat map to look at more specific details of the data in that corresponding row and column. The color and size of the heat map can be adjusted by changing the scales at the top of the graph. 

#WTRA_SA_SIG
@Similarity in groups 
This analysis shows the average value of similarity between pairwise samples in one data set. 

#WTRA_SA_SSM
@Samples similarity matrix 
This analysis shows similarities within each group, defined by the average similarity between all paired samples in two related data sets. The colors and size of the heat map can be adjusted by using the bars on top of the graph.

#WTRA_SA_CA
@ Cluster analysis 
The analysis shows the similarity matrix of all grouped data sets together, using several available methods for cluster analysis. The cluster analysis is performed with the similarity profiles between all grouped TCR sequencing datasets. The similarity profiles of one grouped TCR sequencing dataset is a vector that represented the similarity between the grouped TCR sequencing dataset to all of the grouped TCR sequencing datasets. 

#WTRA_SA_PSA
@Pairwise similarity analysis 
This analysis categorizes the similarity indices between selected sample groups, and performs statistical testing on these grouped samples. If the experimental samples are paired, a paired t-test can be performed if the user selects the paired option.

#WTRA_DA_BDI
@Bio-diversity index 
Samples are combined according to the factors listed in the experiment design file, and used to calculate the biodiversity index.
